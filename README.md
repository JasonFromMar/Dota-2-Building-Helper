# Dota 2 Building Helper v2.1

This is an attempt at rewriting most of the Building Helper core to add or improve support for:
* Multiplayer
* Multiple builders building multiple buildings at the same time
* Shift-Queueing (like RTS games)


The intent is that this will be merged back in to Building Helper once it's working but for the moment it's very work in progress (read: not working)
The code and API it exposes should remain the same once it's done so developers shouldn't need to change anything.

If you want the current actually functional Building Helper, go here. [Building-Helper](https://github.com/Myll/Dota-2-Building-Helper)
