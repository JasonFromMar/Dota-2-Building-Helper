# Dota 2 Building Helper v2.1

This is an attempt at rewriting most of the Building Helper core to add or improve support for:
* Multiplayer
* Multiple builders building multiple buildings at the same time
* Shift-Queueing (like RTS games)

With that in mind I'm just setting up the framework at the moment so it's almost entierly non-functional. 
The code and API it exposes should remain the same once it's done so developers shouldn't need to change anything.

If you want the current actually functional Building Helper, go here. [Building-Helper](https://github.com/Myll/Dota-2-Building-Helper)
